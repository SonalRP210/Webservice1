Spring boot version 2.7.1 and therefore the latest Spring Framework 5.3.22
supports Java 17 while also remaining compatible with Java 11 and 8.

RestTemplate Blocking Client
RestTemplate uses the Java Servlet API, which is based on the thread-per-request model.
This means that the thread will block until the web client receives the response.
The problem with the blocking code is due to each thread consuming some amount of memory and CPU cycles.
Consequently, the application will create many threads, which will exhaust the thread pool or occupy all the available memory.

Spring webclient Non-Blocking Reactive
WebClient uses an asynchronous, non-blocking solution provided by the Spring Reactive framework.
The Reactive framework uses an event-driven architecture. It provides means to compose asynchronous logic through the Reactive Streams API.
As a result, the reactive approach can process more logic while using fewer threads and system resources, compared to the synchronous/blocking method.
WebClient is part of the Spring WebFlux library.
supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios.
WebClient is a non-blocking, reactive client to perform HTTP requests, exposing a fluent, reactive API over underlying HTTP client libraries such as Reactor Netty.
